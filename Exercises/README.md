# Exercises

Exercises represent work that we'll do in class for a given lesson. For example, in Lesson 00, the first exercise it to build a photo collection app.

You'll find sample code as well that you can use as a starting point in your own practice or a point of comparison from what we do in class.

Correctness is not as important an issue with these exercises as understanding.
